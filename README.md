Polynomials

Linked-list implementation of polynomials. Allows for various operations, including:
    Addition
    Subtraction
    Multiplication
    Exponent
    Modulus
    
To run, simply add the three files Main.cpp, Polynomial.h, and Polynomial.cpp to the same project and hit run.

You will be prompted to enter a command. If you want to enter a new polynomial, you will be prompted to enter coefficients and exponents of your terms. Then, you can save the polynomial. You can save as many polynomials as you wish.

Note that if you want to perform an operation, you must enter the equals sign followed by the appropriate arguments/operator.

The polynomial class is implemented as a linked list in descending order, sorted by exponent. This property is maintained in the addToList function.
