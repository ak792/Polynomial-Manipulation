\f0\fs24 \cf0 Polynomials\
\
To run, simply add the three files Main.cpp, Polynomial.h, and Polynomial.cpp to the same project and hit run.\
\
You will be prompted to enter a command. If you want to enter a new polynomial, you will be prompted to enter coefficients and exponents of your terms. Then, you can save the polynomial. You can save as many polynomials as you wish.\
\
Note that if you want to perform an operation, you must enter the equals sign followed by the appropriate arguments/operator.\
\
The polynomial class is implemented as a linked list in descending order, sorted by exponent. This property is maintained in the addToList function. }
